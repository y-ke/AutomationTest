# AutomationTest

## Project

Using your language / test framework of your choice, create test(s) to validate Instawork (www.instawork.com) appears first in a Google search for a given keyword.

If we do not appear first, the test should find out which position on the list our site appears in the search results.

### Bonus Points
Support multiple browsers

Accept google search terms as input
